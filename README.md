Cisco IOS Ansible Playbooks for demonstration purposes

Some of these playbooks are very simple, but hopefully someone will find use in them . These playbooks are mostly written for Cisco IOS devices and known to work under Ansible 2.2

There are for example purposes only and are presented without warranty.  Also, understand that I'm a network guy, not a programmer.  There may be more optimal ways to perform these tasks, but these work in my environment.
